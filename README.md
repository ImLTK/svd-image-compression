# üñºÔ∏è Image Compression with SVD

This project demonstrates how **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** can be used to compress images by reducing their rank.  
It‚Äôs a fun way to see how math concepts can actually shrink image size while keeping most of the details!

## What this project does
- Loads an image and converts it to grayscale  
- Applies **SVD decomposition**!!  
- Reconstructs the image at different ranks (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50,100 was used in the notebook)
